For this project, we made all that was required from us. We can use it with FUSE, with a shell that we implemented and all the functions are useable (even the SHA one). Since it took us a consequent load of work, we didn't go further but implementing the possibility to edit the file with FUSE would have been really interesting.

We have passed approximately 75 hours on this project each, sometimes working together, sometimes each one on is own.
